# GifSaver Fuse
This fuse helps you create gifs from Davinci Resolve Fusion.

Download the file GIFSaver.fuse

(easiest way is to select the green "code" drop down menu on github, download ZIP, and copy the file from the zip)
In Windows it's easiest to right click, save as and download and save the file to:

C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Fuses

On a Mac you should find the Fuses folder under:

Library\Application Support\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Fuses

After downloading the file and saving it in the folder, you will need to restart Davinci Resolve if you already have it open. Otherwise it won't show.
